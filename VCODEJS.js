	[`	External causes of morbidity and mortality	`,`	(V01-Y98) Accidents (V01-X59) Transport accidents (V01-V99) Note: This section is structured in 12 groups. Those relating to land transport accidents (V01-V89) reflect the victim's mode of transport and are subdivided to identify the victim's "counterpart" or the type of event. The vehicle of which the injured person is an occupant is identified in the first two characters since it is seen as the most important factor to identify for prevention purposes. Excl.: accidents to persons engaged in the maintenance or repair of transport equipment or vehicle (not in motion) unless injured by another vehicle in motion (W00-X59) accidents involving vehicles, but unrelated to the hazards associated with the means of transportation, e.g., injuries received in a fight on board ship; transport vehicle involved in a cataclysm; finger crushed when shutting car door (W00-X59) assault by crashing of motor vehicle (Y03) event of undetermined intent (Y31-Y33) intentional self-harm (X81-X83) Definitions related to transport accidents 	`,`	null	`],
